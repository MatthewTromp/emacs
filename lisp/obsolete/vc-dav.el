;;; Commentary:

;;; Todo:
;;
;; - Some methods need to be updated to match the current vc.el.
;;     - rename "version" -> "revision"
;;     - some methods need to take a fileset as a parameter instead of a
;;       single file.

;;; Code:

(require 'url)
(require 'url-dav)

  ;; This should PUT the resource and release any locks that we hold.
  )

(defun vc-dav-checkout (_url &optional _rev _destfile)
  "Check out revision REV of URL into the working area.

If EDITABLE is non-nil URL should be writable by the user and if
locking is used for URL, a lock should also be set.

If REV is non-nil, that is the revision to check out.  If REV is the
empty string, that means to check out the head of the trunk.

If optional arg DESTFILE is given, it is an alternate filename to
write the contents to."
  ;; This should LOCK the resource.

(defun vc-dav-revert (_url &optional _contents-done)
  "Revert URL back to the current workfile version.

If optional arg CONTENTS-DONE is non-nil, then the contents of FILE
have already been reverted from a version backup, and this function
only needs to update the status of URL within the backend."

  ;; Should UNLOCK the file.

If REV1 and REV2 are non-nil report differences from REV1 to REV2.
If REV1 is nil, use the current workfile version as the older version.
If REV2 is nil, use the current workfile contents as the nwer version.

It should return a status of either 0 (no differences found), or
1 (either non-empty diff or the diff is run asynchronously)."
  ;; We should do this asynchronously...

;; vc-dir support
;;
;; vc-dav-receive-file(url rev)
;;    Let this backend `receive' a file that is already registered

;; vc-dav-unregister(url)
